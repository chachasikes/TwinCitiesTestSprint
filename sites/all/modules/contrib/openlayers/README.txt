    arrays which can be used in various places
  * Layers - Adds multiple layer types and layers
    that can be used in maps
  * Behaviors - Adds extra functionality to maps
    like Popups and Tooltips
  * CCK - Allows integration with CCK so that geo data
    can be inputted via a map
  * Views - Allows data to be displayed on a map
    via Views
  * Filters - Creates a filter to replace
    [openlayers preset_name] with a map.
